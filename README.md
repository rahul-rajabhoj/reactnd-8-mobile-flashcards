# Mobile Flashcards

This is the code for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Native course. This app will allow users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks. This project encompasses the fundamental aspects of building a native application including handling infinite lists, routing, and user input.

## How to Load the App

The project uses Node.js and the Create-React-Native-App starter. If you do not have Node >= 10.x installed, you can download it here: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Once Node is installed, navigate to the directory where you want to store the app

```
git clone https://github.com/rahul-rajabhoj/reactnd-8-mobile-flashcards.git
yarn install
```

Once all of the dependencies have been installed you can launch the app with

```
expo start
```
